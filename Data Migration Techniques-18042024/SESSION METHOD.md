  ## HERE IF WE RUN THE PROGRAM WE DONT GETS ANY OUTPUT AFTER IT EXECUTES.
  IN CASE OF SESSION METHOD WE HAVE TO GO TO SM35
  - WE CAN SEE OUR ENTRY IN SM35

  - WE CAN SEE STATUS AS NEW
  - IT MEANS A NEW SESION HAS BEEN CREATED BUT NOT PROCESSED YET..
  - SO WE NEED TO PROCESS IT NOW.

  - ITS SAME AS CALL TXN ALL SCREEN NO SCREEN AND ERROR.
  - LAST STEP IS TO CHECK MARA AND MAKT TABLE AND VERIFY THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DATA.
  - WE PASSED KEEP = X EARLIER
  - MEANS IT WILL KEEP THE ENTRY EVEN AFTER SESSION IS PROCESSED.
