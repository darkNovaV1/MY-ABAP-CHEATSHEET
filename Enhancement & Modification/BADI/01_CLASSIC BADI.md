# TASK ðŸ“ƒâœ’
### our task is to stop user from creating material from mm01 if the measure unit is KG.
### we want to stop customeres from creating material if material measure unit is KG.

## this is developer preferebble way..bcoz we have option of debugging in this option.
#CL_EXITHANDLER
-this class is use to find classic badi only.
- SE24 is the tcode for class.
- SE18 is the tcode for BADI Defination.

>[!NOTE]
> # STEPS
>  goto mm01 and create the material just fill the basic info and dont save it
> then goto #CL_EXITHANDLER and put the breakpoint at case sysubrc., then hit save at mm01 and breakpoint will trigger.

> at this place we will get all the classic badi.
> now goto se18 and check if that badi is useful to you or not. whether you have any interface thats useful or not.

> we will check defination and guess whether thats useful or not. and we are able to find the BADI and badi is # BADI_MATERIAL_CHECK

## we have two more methods to find the classic badi

# ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ·

## now as we know which badi is useful to us so now we need to implement the BADI.
