badi who have enhancement spot are new badi and rest are classic badi.

# Lets take the requiremnent and start working on that..
### lets say client brings the requiremnt that we dont want this two additional buttons in mmo1 tcode. iein 
application toolbar.

```
|-menubar
|-function keys
|-titlebar
|-application toolbar
```

- this is what can help us achieve our requiremnt.

>[!NOTE]
>this badi is in enhancement spot so means thats a new badi or kernal badi
>so this is the most prefereable way to find badi just put the break statement at get badi and call badi.
> this is the first way sencond and third way is same as the classic BADI.

goto se19

we will pass the enhancement spot of badi

right now it same as badi bt might nt always.

enhanceent implementation is the container for badi implementation.

- save it
- in next screen, give name of badi implementation.
- then choose the respective badi in badi defination.
- give implementation class name, in normal badi it comes atomatically but here we have to provide.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/493e0de2-acb7-4296-a6f8-724a890847ab)
- so for this badi defination, we are creating this badi implementation,and this badi implementation is store into which contaiener??? enhancement implementation.
- ok and save

- double click the class
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/24058c81-cc12-41e9-976f-62702bec7a4d)
- now we want to write thee logic in this particular method.
- but we will double click all the methods so that it gets implemented.
- activate

>-  now we left with one part we need to write the logic to exclude/hide that two buttons.
>-  now we wnt to write the code in this method.
>-  ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/e2565ab0-3078-4a2f-b613-b22b55f286c7)
>-  if we check the parameters of this method we found this internal table,it clearly says you can pass the functions that are activated or deactivated.

>-  so we will simply pass the function code of that two buttons.

>-  we will goto change mode of this implementation,
>-  now in implementing class

>-  in ths particular method we will write the code.
>-  we need to fill this internal table. we will pass the function code that we want to deactivate.
