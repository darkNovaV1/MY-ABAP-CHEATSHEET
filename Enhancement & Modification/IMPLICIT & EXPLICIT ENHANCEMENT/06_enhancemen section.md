NOW WE NEED TO CREATE THE ENHANCEMENTS POINTS IN THE PROGRAM..

STEP 1 :

STEP  2: WE WILL CREATE A NEW ENHANCEMENT POINT..
ENHANCEMENT POINT: ZEP_201, ENHANCESPOT NAME: ZESPOT_201

>[!NOTE]
> so now we have learning about how sap provided enhanceent points and how can we make it.
>
> now in this program we hace sum and subtraction of 2 numbers , now we willl see how to do multiplication of two numbers.
>
> so now we will implement the enhancement point we created.
>
> we will right click on the point and create implementation.
>
>make sure you have enabled the jalebibai(that spiral icon)

> ## so we have learnt how to create enhancement points and now we will see enhancements section.
>
>we will create enhancement section after enhancement point ends.

we have passed the default implementaion for learning purpose.
