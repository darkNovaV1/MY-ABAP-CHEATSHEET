## `We will learn to use abstract class using SE24 as well as direct coding.`

-> Never take abstract class as final, else how would we extend that class.

-> we will declare the method and parameters, importing and exporting..

-> currently this method is not an abstract method, so if we neeed to make it we wil go to this button, `properties.`

And from here, we can convert this method to abstract.

`change and activate.`

### -> `Now we will create sub-class from this abstract class.`


#### -> `From this subclass we will create 2 sub classes, one to display sales order details, and one to display billing details.`

1. Sub class can be final, not an issue.
2. ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/a498bfcd-c4c8-41cc-b9fb-84ea286d4fa6)
3. in properties > superclass we will pass the superclass name.
4. ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/5c9e0376-6812-4d5d-b248-64736084e066)
5. when we goto method and try to activate, it will give us error.
6. because this method is declared in our abstract/super classs, we need to define this method.
7. ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/6976ed6b-ff60-4673-82ab-49a7d6481698)
8. now we will create another subclass.

14. `we declared the method once in the superclass, but both sub classes have implemented in there own way..this is called polymorphism`

 #`PROGRAM`
 1. Now we will create a program, that will print sales order deteils or billing details depending on the condition.
 2. ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/17d9d54c-2923-4403-8de0-6fc9ccd60e96)

 4. whenever user will click the first radio button, we will call the method of first subclass and likewise.
 5. ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/MY-ABAP-CHEATSHEET/assets/49744703/a186b7fe-b82b-4e54-ba9f-2bad5994ae03)

 8. wrap with `IF_ELSE`
